Dropped and created the database

•Knex file is in the root so dotenv file shouldn't need to pass a path to it..?
•tried importing dotenv into config.js
  import dotenv from 'dotenv';
  dotenv.config();

ran 
  npm run migrate
  npm run seed

ran into error:
  "error: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "174.101.64.109", user "hxelpdjqtbrsap", database "d32044le9gel4q", SSL off..."
  --> db isn't letting your app communicate with it

file def: pg_hba.conf controls who can access your database

modified postgresql.conf
  (location = '*')
  https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/83984/connect-to-postgresql-server-fatal-no-pg-hba-conf-entry-for-host
restarted postgre
  pg_ctl restart
still receiving error
pulled up pg_hba.conf.sample...? to modify

A: DATABASE_URL was set to heroku url when it needed to be set to local host
